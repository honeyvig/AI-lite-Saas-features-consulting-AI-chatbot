# AI-lite-Saas-features-consulting-AI-chatbot
Build a lite SaaS mainly features AI consulting chatbot for B2B / GTM, including some major functions / features as following:

(1) AI chatbot, talking to clients to clarify their requirements of sales (objectives, materials, ICP, budget, etc),  integrate with LLM API, rag for the chatbot and fine tuning (using 3rd party like human-loop is acceptable)

(2) basic saas function: user modules, payment (stripe, deposit and auto recharge), leads scoring (simple algorithum)

(3) API integration with database, and some martech tools

Above is a complete project (including deployment and debugging), the MVP phase
=============
Building a lightweight SaaS platform with an AI chatbot for B2B sales objectives and lead scoring requires integrating multiple components and third-party services. I'll break down the project into core features and provide Python code for each major feature. Here is a high-level plan for this system:
Key Features

    AI Chatbot: The chatbot will interact with users to gather sales requirements (e.g., objectives, budget, ICP). It will integrate with an LLM API (such as OpenAI or a custom model) and a RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) model for better responses.
    SaaS Functions: User modules for management, Stripe payments (for subscriptions), and automatic recharge.
    Lead Scoring: A basic algorithm to score leads based on predefined criteria.
    API Integration: Integration with databases and marketing tools (e.g., HubSpot, Salesforce).
    Deployment: The project will be deployed on DigitalOcean, with relevant CI/CD pipelines and debugging tools.

Requirements

    Backend: Python with Flask (or FastAPI), Stripe API for payments, AI integration (e.g., GPT-3 or GPT-4 from OpenAI).
    Frontend: React or any JavaScript framework for the user interface.
    Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB to store user data, lead details, and payment information.
    Deployment: DigitalOcean for hosting the app and database.

Step 1: AI Chatbot Integration with LLM API and Fine-tuning

We'll use OpenAI GPT (or any other LLM provider) for the AI chatbot and integrate it via API.
chatbot.py - Flask app with AI chatbot interaction:

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import openai

# Initialize Flask app
app = Flask(__name__)

# OpenAI API Key
openai.api_key = 'your-openai-api-key'

# Simple function to interact with the LLM API (like GPT-3 or GPT-4)
def get_chatbot_response(prompt):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",  # You can use other models here like GPT-4
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Route to handle chatbot queries
@app.route('/chatbot', methods=['POST'])
def chatbot():
    user_message = request.json.get("message")
    prompt = f"Sales Assistant: {user_message} \nPlease clarify the client's requirements regarding sales objectives, ICP, budget, etc."
    chatbot_response = get_chatbot_response(prompt)
    return jsonify({"response": chatbot_response})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Fine-Tuning with HumanLoop (or similar services):

    HumanLoop provides a platform for improving the model’s performance based on user feedback. After gathering chat logs and user inputs, you can fine-tune your model using such services. For example, using openai.FineTune.create() to fine-tune based on your sales use case data.

Step 2: Basic SaaS Functions
User Management, Authentication, and Payment Integration

We'll use Stripe for managing payments (subscriptions, deposits, auto-recharge), and Flask-SQLAlchemy for managing users in the database.

    Install dependencies:

    pip install stripe flask-sqlalchemy flask-login

    Set up the database:

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
import stripe

app = Flask(__name__)

# Configurations for SQLAlchemy and Stripe
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///users.db'  # Use PostgreSQL in production
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'your-secret-key'
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

# Initialize Stripe API Key
stripe.api_key = 'your-stripe-secret-key'

# User Model for the Database
class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    email = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)
    password = db.Column(db.String(120), nullable=False)
    plan = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=True)

# Route to create a new user
@app.route('/signup', methods=['POST'])
def signup():
    email = request.json.get('email')
    password = request.json.get('password')
    new_user = User(email=email, password=password)
    db.session.add(new_user)
    db.session.commit()
    return jsonify({"message": "User created successfully"}), 201

# Stripe Payment Route
@app.route('/charge', methods=['POST'])
def charge():
    amount = 5000  # in cents for subscription fee
    token = request.json.get('stripe_token')

    try:
        charge = stripe.Charge.create(
            amount=amount,
            currency='usd',
            description="SaaS Subscription",
            source=token,
        )
        return jsonify({"message": "Payment successful!"}), 200
    except stripe.error.StripeError as e:
        return jsonify({"error": str(e)}), 400

if __name__ == '__main__':
    db.create_all()  # Create all tables
    app.run(debug=True)

Lead Scoring Algorithm

For simplicity, let's say the scoring is based on three parameters: Budget, Engagement Level, and Decision-Maker Status.

def score_lead(lead):
    score = 0
    if lead['budget'] > 10000:
        score += 30
    if lead['engagement_level'] > 7:
        score += 40
    if lead['is_decision_maker']:
        score += 30
    return score

This is a very basic lead scoring function, but you can enhance it further by using AI or ML models to predict the likelihood of a lead converting to a customer.
Step 3: API Integration with Database and Martech Tools

We'll set up a simple API to handle integrations with marketing tools like HubSpot or Salesforce. Here’s an example of how you could integrate with HubSpot via their API.
Example HubSpot API Integration:

import requests

HUBSPOT_API_KEY = 'your-hubspot-api-key'

# Create a new contact in HubSpot
def create_hubspot_contact(first_name, last_name, email):
    url = f'https://api.hubapi.com/contacts/v1/contact?hapikey={HUBSPOT_API_KEY}'
    data = {
        "properties": [
            {"property": "firstname", "value": first_name},
            {"property": "lastname", "value": last_name},
            {"property": "email", "value": email}
        ]
    }
    response = requests.post(url, json=data)
    return response.json()

# Example route for creating a contact in HubSpot
@app.route('/hubspot/contact', methods=['POST'])
def hubspot_contact():
    first_name = request.json.get('first_name')
    last_name = request.json.get('last_name')
    email = request.json.get('email')
    result = create_hubspot_contact(first_name, last_name, email)
    return jsonify(result)

This code integrates with HubSpot to create new contacts based on user data.
Step 4: Deployment to DigitalOcean

For deployment, you’ll typically want to:

    Set up a Droplet on DigitalOcean.
    Install Docker to containerize your app and database.
    Set up a CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions or similar) for continuous integration and deployment.
    Secure your application with SSL certificates (Let’s Encrypt or similar).
    Set up environment variables for sensitive data like API keys, database URIs, etc.

Conclusion

This MVP phase for a B2B SaaS AI chatbot involves:

    AI-powered chatbot (via OpenAI or other LLMs) to interact with clients.
    User management and Stripe payment integration for subscriptions.
    Lead scoring using a basic algorithm, with the possibility of expanding it into machine learning models.
    API integrations with CRM tools like HubSpot or Salesforce.

To move forward, you can refine the AI model, enhance the lead scoring algorithm with machine learning, and scale the system to handle larger numbers of users. After successfully completing the MVP, future phases would include refining the UX, expanding API integrations, and deploying the app on a robust cloud infrastructure like DigitalOcean.
